# Fireathon
## Data against wildfires

After the devastating fire in 2018 which claimed the live of 100 civilians in Mati, Greece, I joined a team to help develop a solution for fire prevention during a hackathon for fires - a *fireathon*. <br>
It was my first attempt at Data Science!<br>
<br>
The code I used is on the notebooks above. The entire project can be found here: http://fireathon.com/?page_id=230
